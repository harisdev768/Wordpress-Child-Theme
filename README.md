# WordPress Child Theme

### How to Setup a Child Theme in WordPress?

To create a child theme, follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Parent Theme:**  
   In our case, we are using the 'Twentytwenty Four' theme.

2. **Create the Child Theme Folder:**  
   Navigate to `/wp-content/themes/` and create a new folder. Name it according to the child theme you are creating (e.g., `twentytwentyfour-child`).

3. **Create the Stylesheet File:**  
   Inside the child theme folder, create a file named `style.css`.

4. **Add the Following Code to `style.css`:**  
   Replace `ChildThemeOfTwentyTwentyFour` with the desired name for your child theme.

   ```css
   /*
   Theme Name:    ChildThemeOfTwentyTwentyFour
   Template:      twentytwentyfour
   */
	```

Note: Make sure to activate your child theme in the WordPress admin after completing these steps.
